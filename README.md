Build a React application that renders 10,000 rows of data in a table with the following requirements:

1.       Implement skeleton loading for rows while data is being fetched.

2.       Use infinite scroll or virtualization so that the table renders smoothly without lag.

3.       Ensure that the table content remains stable (no flickering or fluctuations) when new data is appended.

4.       Scrolling experience should be smooth and performant.

5.       Add sorting and filtering functionality.
